The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan is going to held grandly at National Cheng Kung University Tainan for the first time starting from 2016/08/08 to 2016/08/12 organised by iGEM NCKU Tainan. In the past few years, only universities from North part of Taiwan attended iGEM Competiton organised by MIT, Boston. This year, NCKU had formed the first team representing South Taiwan as a succes of historical breakthrough. By involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competiton, we believe that we can improve multidisciplinary cooperation. Besides, to connect every schools in Taiwan also branched out tentatively into international platform.
We estimated more than 5 countries, approximately 20 teams from different schools will be attending this Meet-up Conferece. Proffesional scholars and entrepreneur will be invited too for academic exchange about Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology. The main programs are inclusive of presentations, poster exhibitions, team experience sharing , Round table , Tainan cultural tours etc.. We truly believed that by this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, the teams are able to have communications, achieving better results as well as making NCKU a step closer to become one of the most popular universities in Asia Pacific and also impress the world.</p>
